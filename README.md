Build Secure Enterprise Angular Apps That Leverage Various Microsoft Tech
=========================================================================

Abstract
--------
Are you building Angular apps for enterprise customers? You likely need to talk to secured services, you need to lock down parts of your app and you need to maintain good application structure to name a few things. In this workshop we’ll build an enterprise Angular app from start to finish in TypeScript and secure sections of the app using Microsoft’s Azure Active Directory. Well see how we can access a user’s mailbox to use their email, contacts and calendar that resides in Office 365. We’ll store files within the user’s OneDrive files. You’ll see how to store collaborative data within lists in Office 365. We’ll do all this using WebStorm, but you can use any text editor. You don’t have to have any experience with Office 365 APIs or Azure AD to participate in this workshop… you’ll learn how to do all of it!

Pre-Requirements: To participate in building the application demonstrated in the workshop, you will need an Office 365 tenant as well as a Microsoft Azure subscription to build this application... you can create trials for these quickly, but you should do it ahead of time.
